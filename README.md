# QuickSelect Algorithm Implementation

This repository contains a Python implementation of the QuickSelect algorithm. QuickSelect is an efficient algorithm for finding the k-th smallest (or largest) element in an unordered list. This implementation uses randomized pivot selection for improved performance.

## Overview

The QuickSelect algorithm works by recursively partitioning the input list around a chosen pivot element until the desired k-th element is found. This implementation employs the following steps:

1. Randomly select a pivot element from the input list.
2. Partition the list into two sublists: elements less than the pivot and elements greater than the pivot.
3. Recur on the appropriate sublist based on the desired k-th element.
4. Repeat the process until the k-th element is found.

## Usage

To use this implementation, simply import the `quick_select` function and provide the input list along with the index of the desired k-th element. Here's an example:

```python
from quickselect import quick_select

arr = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5]
k = 4
result = quick_select(arr, 0, len(arr) - 1, k)
print("The", k, "th smallest element is:", result)
```
